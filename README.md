# Lights Out! - A Memory Challenge Game
**This game tests your memory and reflexes! Here's how it works:**

- **Gameplay**:
You'll see a building with multiple windows that light up and turn off after a short interval. Your task is to remember which windows lit up. Once the lights go out, you'll have a limited time to click on the windows you recall were previously illuminated.
- **Increasing Difficulty**:
 As time progresses within the one-minute play session, the difficulty ramps up. More windows will light up, and the duration they stay lit will decrease, making it more challenging to remember.
- **Login and Difficulty**:
Before playing, you can choose to either:
  - Enter a username and password (optional)
  - Play anonymously

  Difficulty selection allows you to tailor the experience to your preference.
- **Results and Ranking**:
After the game concludes, you'll be presented with your results alongside the top player statistics.
